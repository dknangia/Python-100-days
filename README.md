#Python 100 Days of Code Challenge 🚀
Welcome to the Python 100 Days of Code Challenge! 🎉 This repository is a journey of learning, coding, and improving Python programming skills by committing to code every day for 100 days.

📖 About the Challenge
The 100 Days of Code Challenge is about building a consistent habit of coding daily. The focus here is on Python, a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language. Each day involves tackling a new project, problem, or concept, ranging from beginner to advanced levels.

📁 Project Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each day, with the following format:


📂 Python-100-Days-Challenge
│
├── Day 01 - Introduction to Python
│   ├── README.md   # Details of the day's challenge
│   └── main.py     # Solution/code
│
├── Day 02 - Data Types and Variables
│   ├── README.md
│   └── main.py
│
... (and so on)

Each day's folder contains:

README.md: Brief description of the day's task, objectives, and learning outcomes.
main.py: Python script(s) implementing the solution
